#### What is Diabetes ?

**Diabetes** is a serious chronic disease that occurs
when sugar levels are high in the blood for a long time.
When a person is fed, the body converts the food into glucose
and enters the bloodstream. Glucose needs insulin to move
through the bloodstream. Insulin is a hormone produced by
the pancreas that regulates blood sugar. If the body has a
problem using or producing insulin, glucose cannot enter the
blood cells. Hyperglycemia occurs when blood sugar levels are
higher than normal, and this situation causes serious problems
in the nervous system and vessels over time [1]. 

#### Features
**Glucose:** A reading of plasma glucose concentrations was
taken 2 hours after subjects were given the oral glucose
test. Looking at the result, individuals with higher glucose
concentrations are more likely to develop diabetes

**Blood Pressure:** One of the factors that increase the likelihood of developing diabetes is blood pressure.

**Skin Thickness:** The factor that determines skin thickness is
collagen content. Skin thickness is higher in insulin-dependent
diabetic patients. When the skinfold of the subjects was
measured, it was determined that people with a skin thickness
of more than 30 mm were at high risk

**Insulin:** If we administer glucose for 2 hours, normal insulin
levels will be 16-166 mU/L. If it is above or below this value,
subjects are at high risk [2].

**Body Mass Index (BMI):** Subjects are slightly more likely
to have diabetes if their BMI is over 25.

**Diabetes Pedigree Function:** It shows the history of diabetes
in people with blood relatives and provides the combination
of the original person and the genetic relationship. If the DPF
is high, the person is likely to be diabetic.

**Age:** Diabetes is a type of disease that can be seen in all
age groups. However, it is most common in adults over the
age of 45. Considering all these factors, it can be said that
individuals in the higher age group are more likely to have
diabetes
